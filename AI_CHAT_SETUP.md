     2) Focus on your message, not yourself, 3) Use the power pose technique..."
```

### Practice Scenario Generation
```
User: *clicks "Interview Practice" button*
AI: "ðŸŽ¯ Practice Scenario Generated:
     
     You're interviewing for a senior marketing position. The interviewer asks: 
     'Tell me about a time when you had to lead a team through a difficult project.'

## Configuration Options

### AI Model Settings
You can modify the AI settings in `server/ai-chat-service.ts`:

```typescript
{
  model: 'gpt-4',           // AI model to use
  max_tokens: 800,          // Maximum response length
  temperature: 0.7,         // Creativity level (0-1)
  presence_penalty: 0.1,    // Encourages new topics
  frequency_penalty: 0.1    // Reduces repetition
}
```

### System Prompt Customization
The system prompt in `ai-chat-service.ts` can be customized to focus on specific communication areas or adjust the coaching style.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"OpenAI API key not configured"**
   - Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your `.env` file
   - Verify the API key is valid and has sufficient credits

2. **"AI service error"**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify OpenAI API status at https://status.openai.com
   - Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions

3. **Slow responses**
   - This is normal for AI processing
   - Responses typically take 2-5 seconds
   - Consider adjusting `max_tokens` for faster responses

### API Rate Limits
- OpenAI has rate limits based on your plan
- Free tier: 3 requests per minute
- Paid plans: Higher limits based on usage tier

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Security**: Never commit your API key to version control
- **Environment Variables**: Always use `.env` files for sensitive data
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents data leaks

## Cost Considerations

- **OpenAI Pricing**: Based on token usage
- **GPT-4**: ~$0.03 per 1K input tokens, ~$0.06 per 1K output tokens
- **Typical Cost**: ~$0.01-0.05 per conversation
- **Monitoring**: Monitor usage in OpenAI dashboard

## Future Enhancements

- **Conversation History**: Persistent chat history
- **Progress Tracking**: User communication improvement metrics
- **Custom Scenarios**: User-defined practice scenarios
- **Multi-language Support**: Communication coaching in different languages
